=======
This project's aim is to practice our SQL skills by creating multiple queries for multiple questions. In order to do this, I used the website https://pgexercises.com/ to write and test my queries and the website https://codebeautify.org/sqlformatter to format my queries.

# SQL queries

###### Table Setup (DDL)

<<<<<<< HEAD
###### Question 1: Show all members 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM cd.members
```

###### Questions 2: Lorem ipsum...

```sql
SELECT blah blah 
```

=======
```sql
CREATE TABLE cd.members (
  memid integer NOT NULL,
  surname character varying(200) NOT NULL,
  firstname character varying(200) NOT NULL,
  address character varying(300) NOT NULL,
  zipcode integer NOT NULL,
  telephone character varying(20) NOT NULL,
  recommendedby integer,
  joindate timestamp NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT members_pk PRIMARY KEY (memid),
  CONSTRAINT  fk_members_recommendedby FOREIGN KEY (recommendedby) REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL
  );

CREATE TABLE cd.facilities
(
    facid integer NOT NULL,
    name character varying(100) NOT NULL,
    membercost numeric NOT NULL,
    guestcost numeric NOT NULL,
    initialoutlay numeric NOT NULL,
    monthlymaintenance numeric NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT facilities_pk PRIMARY KEY (facid)
);

CREATE TABLE cd.bookings (
  bookid integer NOT NULL, 
  facid integer NOT NULL, 
  memid integer NOT NULL, 
  starttime timestamp NOT NULL, 
  slots integer NOT NULL, 
  CONSTRAINT bookings_pk PRIMARY KEY (bookid), 
  CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_facid FOREIGN KEY (facid) REFERENCES cd.facilities(facid),

);
```

###### Question 1: Show all members 

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,

VALUES
    (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);

```

###### Question 2: Insert calculated data into a table

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,
    initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
)
SELECT
    facid + 1,
    'Spa',
    20,
    30,

LIMIT
    1;

```

###### Question 3: Update some existing data

    cd.facilities
SET
    initialoutlay = 10000
WHERE
    facid = 1;

```

###### Question 4: Update a row based on the contents of another row

SET 
  membercost =(
    SELECT 
      membercost * 1.1 
    FROM 
      cd.facilities 
    WHERE 
      facid = 0
  ), 
  guestcost =(
    SELECT 
      guestcost * 1.1

    WHERE 
      facid = 0
  ) 
WHERE 
  facid = 1;
```

###### Question 5: Delete all bookings

DELETE FROM cd.bookings;
```

###### Question 6: Delete a member from the cd.members table

```sql
DELETE FROM

```sql
SELECT 
  facid, 
  name, 
  membercost, 
  monthlymaintenance 
FROM 
  cd.facilities 
WHERE 
  membercost <(monthlymaintenance / 50) 
  AND membercost > 0;
```

###### Question 8: Basic string searches
