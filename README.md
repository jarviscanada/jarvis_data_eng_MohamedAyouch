# Mohamed Ayouch . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent software engineering graduate from Concordia University, and my love for the world of software began when I was just 16 years old, exploring Java coding. Ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to build a career in this field. Although this position with Jarvis is my first work experience in the domain, I had the opportunity to work on a significant Capstone project during my bachelor's studies. This project not only enriched my skills in web development but also offered valuable insights into project management. I am excited to bring my passion and dedication to a dynamic role in the software industry.
